Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: We consider using Git because it helps manage code and data changes
when working with a team. It also helps manage and track changes in your code
as a developer. You are able to go back and see earlier versions of your code
if necessary in case something goes wrong or if you just want to see what
your code looked like at a certain point in time. You can also develop
simultaneously on different branches and easily collaborate with other 
developers when using Git.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to?
Give an Example and how it might help

Answer: Data Science can be applied to almost any field that details with
large amounts of data. An example of such a field is healthcare. In healthcare,
data science can be used to analyze medical records and patient data to
improve patient outcomes. For instance, by analyzing medical records of
patients, scientists can build predictive models to aid doctors in identifying
patients who are at high risk for certain conditions such as Alzheimer's or
diabetes.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing on Git has to do with
how they combine changes from different branches into one and how they handle
the project repository. Merging combines the work from different branches while
maintaining the existing commit history of each branch while rebasing is a way
of integrating changes from one branch into another by replaying the commits
of the branch on top of another branch, creating a linear commit history.
Merging is generally a safer option because it preserves the entire history
of your repository.
