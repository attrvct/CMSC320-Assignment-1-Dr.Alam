Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We consider using Git because it helps manage code and data changes
when working with a team. It also helps manage and track changes in your code
as a developer. You are able to go back and see earlier versions of your code
if necessary in case something goes wrong or if you just want to see what
your code looked like at a certain point in time. You can also develop
simultaneously on different branches and easily collaborate with other 
developers when using Git.
